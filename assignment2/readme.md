This is all very new to me so at times when reading all the modules and watching the videos I feel as though my head is going to explode. Because I am trying to learn so much new information I sometimes wonder if any of this information is really sticking. But as I went through the practice and the assignment I was pleased with how much information I retained from the last assignment and the new information that was added this week. I understand that this material will keep getting more difficulty but it feels good to go through an assignment, problem solve any difficulties, and come out with an assignment that looks as it should. I also loved learning about Lightshot, this will make my life much easier in the PC world.
