      <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
        <pre>
          The girl in the pastry shop with the net in her hair
          Is making a cannoli for you to take on your hiking trip
          In the woods with your bros that you’ve known since second grade
          And you may encounter dragons or ruffians and be called upon
          To employ your testosterone
          In a battle for supremacy and access to females glued to the TV
          And even if you are victorious you may receive many cuts, bruises, and scrapes
          And you will require band aids and antiseptic ointments
          And tender loving kisses on your stab wounds and when you come home
          She will be there waiting for you with a fire in her eyes
          And a big fat cannoli to shove in your mouth
          And that's why you

          Thank God for girls
          Holla Jesu Christe
          From Tennessee to LA
          Thank God for girls
          On your reckoning day
          You better bow down and pray
          
          She’s so big
          She’s so strong
          She’s so energetic in her sweaty overalls
          Thank God for girls
          Thank God for girls
          Thank God for girls

          I'm so glad I got a girl to think of even though she isn't mine
          I think about her all the day and all the night it's enough to know that she's alive
          She says I give her sweaty palms she almost had a heart attack
          The truth is that I’m just as scared I don’t know how to act
          I wish that I could get to know her better
          But meeting up in real life would cause the illusion to shatter
          I carved her name into all the trees
          Sang a song down on one knee
          Looking at the underwear page of the Sears catalog like when I was 14
          I’m levitating like a magnet turned the wrong way around
          I’m like an Indian Fakir tryna’ meditate on a bed of nails with my pants pulled down

          Thank God for girls
          Holla Jesu Christe
          From Tennessee to LA
          Thank God for girls
          On your reckoning day
          You better bow down and pray

          She’s so big
          She’s so strong
          She’s so energetic in her sweaty overalls
          Thank God for girls
          Thank God for girls
          Thank God for girls

          God took a rib from Adam, ground it up in a centrifuge machine
          Mixed it with cardamom and cloves, microwaved it on the popcorn setting
          While Adam was like “that really hurts”
          Going off into the tundra, so pissed at God
          And he started lighting minor forest fires, stealing osprey eggs
          Messing with the bees who were trying to pollinate the echinacea
          Until God said, “Ima smite you with loneliness
          And break your heart in two”
          And Adam wept and wailed, tearing out his hair, falling on his knees
          Looked to the sky and said
          “Thank God”
