# Technical Report for Project 1
---
I use the Chrome browser to surf the web on my pc and Safari when using my phone. According to our lectures from this week an internet browser is a software program that helps connect our devices to the internet and translates code into the web pages we view.

Using the WayBack Machine I traveled back in time to when you could not be on the internet and the phone at the same time and Ask Jeeves was the way to go when you had a question. Using the WayBack machine I visited Yahoo circa 1996. It was basic in its layout and looks more like Craigslist than the Yahoo we know and love today. I go on Yahoo about once a day and do a quick scan of the "news", it is intuitive and much more appealing to the eye these days.

#### Work Cycle
In preparation for this week's project I went through the different modules and activities in Moodle.
