# Technical Report for Project 1
---
I use the Chrome browser to surf the web on my pc and Safari when using my phone. According to our lectures from this week an internet browser is a software program that helps connect our devices to the internet and translates code into the web pages we view.

Using the WayBack Machine I traveled back in time to when you could not be on the internet and the phone at the same time and Ask Jeeves was the way to go when you had a question. Using the WayBack machine I visited Yahoo circa 1996. It was basic in its layout and looks more like Craigslist than the Yahoo we know and love today. I go on Yahoo about once a day and do a quick scan of the "news", it is intuitive and much more appealing to the eye these days.

#### Work Cycle
In preparation for this week's project I went through the different modules and activities in Moodle. I then went into Atom to create my index for Project 1 and created the 4 main document elements. I then went through trial and error when figuring out where to put the title "My First Webpage". When copying and pasting my lyrics I did not like the first layout I chose so I had to change that. After getting everything the way I wanted it to look I went to get the link and then something happened. The link was working so I tried renaming my folder and all of a sudden the links for everything I was working on turned yellow and all my work disappeared. That was frustrating. Luckily I had saved often so I was able to go back into my repo history and pull up the code and copy and paste it back into Atom and then re-add my image.

I asked one question on the github issues board and that is how do I know what size my image is? Although I read all the issues and posts on the github issues board I do not feel like I am in a place where I can be of help to other students.
