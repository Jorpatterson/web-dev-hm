# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Jordan Patterson
I signed up for this class because I have a program website I need to maintain as part of my job. I do the bare minimum with this website because I have no idea what I am doing. When I do change things in the website it involves a lot of uneducated clicking around. I have a lot of ideas but no idea on how to execute them. From this class I am hoping to be able to make some major changes to my website, or at the very least have a better understanding on how to change things.

But what exactly is the internet? Things I learned:
+ Nobody and everybody controls the internet. It is made up of many independently operated networks, there is no central control.
+ The internet connects participants the web connects information.
+ Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn invented the internet as a result of another project called the ARPANET.
+ The internet is connected from one person to another, city to city, country to country, via many wires and cables.
