## Technical Report for Assignment 7
For my font I tried to get as close to the New York Times heading font as I could and for the rest I tried to pick fonts that were reminiscent of newspaper font.

System fonts are the fonts that are available on your device but may not translate to the web.

Web fonts are custom fonts that are hosted on a server. They are made specifically for web viewing.

Web-safe fonts are fonts that the client already has are able to be viewed using different systems.

Fallback/stacked fonts are necessary in case the first font choice is not available to the client. By having fallback fonts you insure there are multiple ways in which the client can view the information.

I thought this week would be a lot easier than it was. Little things have been tripping me up, which is frustrating. But I do feel more confident and have many favorite websites where I can find answers.
