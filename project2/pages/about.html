      <b>My name is Jordan Patterson, I work full time, have three kids, a great husband, and am working on my degree in Anthropology.
      I love cooking and entertaining but am usually short on time. <br>
      When I cook I need it to be fast and there needs to be a way to incoporate my helpers, who are a constant in my kitchen.

      I usually serve them every Thanksgiving and they are always a big hit. This recipe is from <cite>rachael ray every day</cite>. For
