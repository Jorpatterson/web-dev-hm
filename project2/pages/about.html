      <div id="Intro Paragraph" class="About Me">
      My name is Jordan Patterson, I work full time, have three kids, a great husband, and am working on my degree in Anthropology.
      I love cooking and entertaining but am usually short on time. When I cook I need it to be fast and there needs to be a way to incoporate my helpers, who are a constant in my kitchen.
      This quick recipe has been a go-to recipe of mine for many years, I usually serve them every Thanksgiving and they are always a big hit.
