      <b>My name is Jordan Patterson, I work full time, have three kids, a great husband, and am working on my degree in Anthropology.
      I love cooking and entertaining but am usually short on time. When I cook I need it to be fast and there needs to be a way to incoporate my helpers, who are a constant in my kitchen.
      This quick recipe has been a go-to recipe of mine for many years, I usually serve them every Thanksgiving and they are always a big hit. This recipe is from <cite>rachel ray every day</cite>.

      Another constant in our house is music and dancing, we may not be very good at the latter but
