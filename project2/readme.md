## Technical Report for Project 2

Learning HTML has been a struggle, to say the least. It has been very difficult to grasp the language, codes, abbreviations, etc. That said when I do finally get something it is great and seeing a web page develope is pretty exciting for me. Building a table and form were especially difficult to wrap my head around, I am still not sure I could build one in less than an hour but it hopefully won't take the two hours it has been taking me.

I am excited and wary of learning CSS. Adding on to the tentative grasp I have on the material is scary. But I am excited to find new ways to decorate the web pages we build.

This work cycle seemed like it would never end. At first I was extremely overwhelmed looking at all we needed to accomplish. Once I started breaking down the different requirements and slowly building the page I became more confident. The biggest problem I had throughout was getting everything to center properly, because I did not like how it looked when it was all aligned left. Getting the pages to look the way I wanted them to look took a lot of trial and error. I pushed to github it seems like hundreds of times just to see if the minute changes I made would make a difference. There was also a lot of Googling that took place, I now have a couple of websites I really like as a supplement to our modules.
